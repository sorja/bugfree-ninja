=============

Bestest thing ever.
Go to consol and go like
npm install in the folder where is index.js
then go like node index.js to be like yeah best.

First command will be so amazing that it will install all dependencies.
The second one is a bit meh, only runs the program and you can see it @ localhost:8080
